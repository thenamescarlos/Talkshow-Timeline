Generates a timeline (structured data) of radio bit and archives from (primarily Youtube) uploads, to be formatted however the respective talk show community wants.


The project was initially for the Ron and Fez Show, but may be used for other shows such as Howard Stern or O&A. It was born from http://www.reddit.com/r/ronandfez/comments/306e2e/ and coincidently the code was first commited on Fez Whatley's April 1st 2015 retirement announcement.
