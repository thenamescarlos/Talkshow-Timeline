Like Snakes and Horses - 38:38<br><br>"Hot Stove Jimmy busted out on the Chicago ska/punk scene in 1996 with their HUGE sound, a sonic avalanche of noise, ska, circus music, hardcore, metal and punk all mixed into....by a 10 person band! Yet, amidst all this aggressive noise and energy, Hot Stove Jimmy finds a way to write catchy songs full of vocal harmonies and melodic breakdowns. CMJ Magazine describes them as "ten young, talented musicians.....their enthusiasm steals the show!", which is well documented in Chicago playing to near sell our crowds at Metro and Fireside. In the past 3 years, Hot Stove Jimmy has been on too many compilations to mention, but have FINALLY returned in full-force with this new album that includes tracks recorded with legendary engineer Steve Albini (Bush, Nirvana, Page/Plant). Yet, if you can believe it, this album sees the band take a more "insane" approach to the ska-core formula, in fact some wouldn't call it ska-core at all. With a nod to the Blue Meanies and Mr Bungle, Hot Stove Jimmy's new album is full of spastic starts & stops, lots of screaming, ear-crushing feedback, aggressive vocals and evil keyboard lines. It is simply one of the loudest albums to have emerged from the ska movement, and this record will definitely see them appeal to new scenes in addition to pleasing their hard core fans!"
